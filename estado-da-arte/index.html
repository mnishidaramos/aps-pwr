                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>
                        In recent year, the Internet of Things (IoT) has drawn significant research attention. IoT is
                        considered as a part of the Internet of the future and will comprise billions of intelligent
                        communicating ‘things’. The future of the Internet will consist of heterogeneously connected
                        devices that will further extend the borders of the world with physical entities and virtual
                        components. The Internet of Things (IoT) will empower the connected things with new
                        capabilities. In this survey, the definitions, architecture, fundamental technologies, and
                        applications of IoT are systematically reviewed. Firstly, various definitions of IoT are
                        introduced; secondly, emerging techniques for the implementation of IoT are discussed;
                        thirdly, some open issues related to the IoT applications are explored; finally, the major
                        challenges which need addressing by the research community and corresponding potential
                        solutions are investigated.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pretz has indicated that the Internet of things (IoT) is a things-connected network, where
                        things
                        are wirelessly connected via smart sensors (Pretz 2013); IoT is able to interact without human
                        intervention. Some preliminary IoT applications have been already developed in healthcare,
                        transportation, and automotive industries (He et al. 2014; Joshi and Kim 2013; Pretz 2013).
                        Currently, IoT technologies are at their infant stages; however, many new developments have
                        occurred in the integration of objects with sensors in the cloud-based Internet (Hepp et al.
                        2007; Joshi and Kim 2013; Pretz 2013). The development of IoT involves many issues such as
                        infrastructure, communications, interfaces, protocols, and standards. We are motivated to
                        summarize the research progress achieved so far in the development, standardization, and
                        security assurance of IoT enabling technologies, and to identify critical research topics and
                        future research directions of IoT.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 1 mainly provides an overview of the
                        definitions, current research, standards, and future research of IoT. In Section 2, the current
                        research on IoT system architecture is discussed. In Section 3, the enabling technologies of IoT
                        are investigated. In Section 4, the applications of IoT are reviewed. Finally, some emerging
                        research issues are identified and the future research directions are discussed.

                    <h1>Multimedia Internet of Things: A Comprehensive Survey</h1>

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>
                        The immense increase in multimedia-on-demand traffic that refers to audio, video, and images,
                        has drastically shifted the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to Multimedia
                        Internet of Things (M-IoT). IoT devices are constrained in terms of energy, computing, size, and
                        storage memory. Delay-sensitive and bandwidth-hungry multimedia applications over constrained
                        IoT networks require revision of IoT architecture for M-IoT. This paper provides a comprehensive
                        survey of M-IoT with an emphasis on architecture, protocols, and applications. This article
                        starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we discuss the issues considering
                        the characteristics of multimedia and provide a summary of related M-IoT architectures. Various
                        multimedia applications supported by IoT are surveyed, and numerous use cases related to road
                        traffic management, security, industry, and health are illustrated to show how different M-IoT
                        applications are revolutionizing human life. We explore the importance of Quality-of-Experience
                        (QoE) and Quality-of-Service (QoS) for multimedia transmission over IoT. Moreover, we explore
                        the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing and present the relationship between the M-IoT
                        and emerging technologies including event processing, feature extraction, cloud computing,
                        Fog/Edge computing and Software-Defined-Networks (SDNs). We also present the need for better
                        routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols for M-IoT. Finally, we present a
                        detailed discussion on the open research issues and several potential research areas related to
                        emerging multimedia communication in IoT.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        The amalgamation of the physical and digital world over the traditional Internet paved the way
                        for the future Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is envisaged as the network model to fill the gap
                        between the cyber and physical world [1]. The core concept of the IoT is to connect the
                        pervasive objects around us, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, mobile devices,
                        sensors and actuators to the Internet through a wired or wireless network. Hence, it enables the
                        objects to interact with each other and their neighbors to enhance the efficiency of the system
                        [1]. Several researchers have defined IoT in various contexts [2]: “The integration of tiny
                        devices known as Smart Objects (SO), usually battery operated equipped with a Microcontroller
                        (MCU) and transceivers into the global Internet. The services offered by these smart objects are
                        known as Smart Services (SS) [3]–[4][5][6]. IoT has created new opportunities for machines to
                        communicate with each other and extend the offered applications. Currently, 23 billion devices
                        are connected to the Internet [7], and these numbers will stretch to 30 billion by 2020 [8].
                        Conventionally, IoT was assimilated relatively in data sensing devices, particularly in the
                        Machine to Machine (M2M) environment [9]. Vigorous growth in the connected devices to the
                        Internet during the last decade and abrupt demand for multimedia traffic has given rise to the
                        emergence of the Multimedia Internet of Things (M-IoT). The equilibrium between QoS data and
                        best-effort data is now in transit towards an increase in multimedia QoS data.

                    <h1>Blockchain for Internet of Things: A Survey</h1>

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Internet of Things (IoT) is reshaping the incumbent industry to smart industry featured with
                        data-driven decision-making. However, intrinsic features of IoT result in a number of
                        challenges, such as decentralization, poor interoperability, privacy, and security
                        vulnerabilities. Blockchain technology brings the opportunities in addressing the challenges of
                        IoT. In this paper, we investigate the integration of blockchain technology with IoT. We name
                        such synthesis of blockchain and IoT as blockchain of things (BCoT). This paper presents an
                        in-depth survey of BCoT and discusses the insights of this new paradigm. In particular, we first
                        briefly introduce IoT and discuss the challenges of IoT. Then, we give an overview of blockchain
                        technology. We next concentrate on introducing the convergence of blockchain and IoT and
                        presenting the proposal of BCoT architecture. We further discuss the issues about using
                        blockchain for fifth generation beyond in IoT as well as industrial applications of BCoT.
                        Finally, we outline the open research directions in this promising area.</p>

                    <h1>A Survey on the Internet of Things (IoT) Forensics: Challenges, Approaches, and Open Issues</h1>

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Today is the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). The recent advances in hardware and information
                        technology have accelerated the deployment of billions of interconnected, smart and adaptive
                        devices in critical infrastructures like health, transportation, environmental control, and home
                        automation. Transferring data over a network without requiring any kind of human-to-computer or
                        human-to-human interaction, brings reliability and convenience to consumers, but also opens a
                        new world of opportunity for intruders, and introduces a whole set of unique and complicated
                        questions to the field of Digital Forensics. Although IoT data could be a rich source of
                        evidence, forensics professionals cope with diverse problems, starting from the huge variety of
                        IoT devices and non-standard formats, to the multi-tenant cloud infrastructure and the resulting
                        multi-jurisdictional litigations. A further challenge is the end-to-end encryption which
                        represents a trade-off between users' right to privacy and the success of the forensics
                        investigation. Due to its volatile nature, digital evidence has to be acquired and analyzed
                        using validated tools and techniques that ensure the maintenance of the Chain of Custody.
                        Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the main issues involved in the
                        complex process of IoT-based investigations, particularly all legal, privacy and cloud security
                        challenges. Furthermore, this work provides an overview of the past and current theoretical
                        models in the digital forensics science. Special attention is paid to frameworks that aim to
                        extract data in a privacy-preserving manner or secure the evidence integrity using decentralized
                        blockchain-based solutions. In addition, the present paper addresses the ongoing
                        Forensics-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm, as well as some promising cross-cutting data reduction
                        and forensics intelligence techniques. Finally, several other research trends and open issues
                        are presented, with emphasis on the need for proactive Forensics Readiness strategies and
                        generally agreed-upon standards.</p>

                    <h1>Machine Learning-Based Network Vulnerability Analysis of Industrial Internet of Things</h1>

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>It is critical to secure the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices because of potentially
                        devastating consequences in case of an attack. Machine learning (ML) and big data analytics are
                        the two powerful leverages for analyzing and securing the Internet of Things (IoT) technology.
                        By extension, these techniques can help improve the security of the IIoT systems as well. In
                        this paper, we first present common IIoT protocols and their associated vulnerabilities. Then,
                        we run a cyber-vulnerability assessment and discuss the utilization of ML in countering these
                        susceptibilities. Following that, a literature review of the available intrusion detection
                        solutions using ML models is presented. Finally, we discuss our case study, which includes
                        details of a real-world testbed that we have built to conduct cyber-attacks and to design an
                        intrusion detection system (IDS). We deploy backdoor, command injection, and Structured Query
                        Language (SQL) injection attacks against the system and demonstrate how a ML-based anomaly
                        detection system can perform well in detecting these attacks. We have evaluated the performance
                        through representative metrics to have a fair point of view on the effectiveness of the methods.
